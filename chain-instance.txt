Intially we will have one main wallet that consists of all the coins that will be used by the users to cast thier votes.
Once the election starts, we have to ensure that the candidates have 0 balance. The users can then cast their votes.
After voting, the winner will be the candidate with the most coins in thier wallet. After that all the coins from the
candidates (and the users who havent voted) will be again put back to the main wallet.
